Motivation:
As students, we were faced with the issue of complex, fast-paced lectures which did not leave us time 
to write notes and pay attention.

What it does:
It transforms speech to text, storing the transcripts. Also, it has a chatbot which answers users' lecture-related questions, offering keywords, definitions, dates or searches from the web.
